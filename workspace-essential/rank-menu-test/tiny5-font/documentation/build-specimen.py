# Procedural specimen images for Tiny5 and Tiny5 Duo.
#
# Every image is an artifact of a fictional 1980s pocket-electronics maker:
# the screens are simulated period displays, drawn entirely in code so the
# font pixels stay crisp and the images can be rendered at any target size.
#
# All text is composed on a low-resolution cell grid (1 image = one display),
# then upscaled with NEAREST so every font pixel maps to whole display cells.
#
# The file runs from the general to the particular: the font, the cell grid,
# the shared image helpers, then one section per device — its constants, its
# renderer and the specimen it builds — in the order the images are numbered.
#
# Every specimen is built once per family: Tiny5 as tiny5-*.jpg, and Tiny5
# Duo as tiny5duo-*.jpg. Duo sets wider than Tiny5, so where a line would
# overflow its display, the Duo specimen carries its own, shorter copy.
#
# Alongside the specimens, the screen is rendered twice more for the itch.io
# project the two families share: tiny5-itch.jpg, its cover image, and
# tiny5-itch-banner.jpg, the banner across the head of its page. Both are
# built for Tiny5 alone.
